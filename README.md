# General Mobile E-Tab4 Root

This is the full exploit used in my blog post [Roots in the Past: General Mobile E-Tab4](https://erfur.github.io/2022/12/04/roots-in-the-past-1.html).

Simply compile with `ndk-build` and push the binary `exynos-abuse`, `su` and `Superuser.apk` to `/data/local/tmp/`, then run it.
